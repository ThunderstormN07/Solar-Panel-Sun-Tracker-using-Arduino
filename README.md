Objective:
This project aims to design an automatic solar panel system that follows the direction of the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy output by ensuring the panel is always oriented directly towards sunlight.

Components Required:
Arduino Uno (or similar microcontroller)
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensors (4 for more precise tracking)
Servo motors (2 for dual-axis tracking)
Solar panel
Motor driver (L298N or similar)
Resistors (for LDR voltage dividers)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply (for Arduino and servos)
Mounting hardware for solar panel and motors

Working Principle:
The solar tracker uses multiple LDR sensors placed at different angles on the panel to detect the intensity of sunlight. By comparing the light levels from these sensors, the Arduino will determine the brightest point, which indicates the sun's direction. Servo motors are used to adjust the panel's orientation in both horizontal and vertical directions (dual-axis tracking) to ensure it is always facing the sun.

Steps:

Mount the LDRs:
Position the four LDR sensors in a cross-like pattern (north, south, east, west) on the solar panel's surface. Each LDR will measure the sunlight in its respective direction.
Control Mechanism:
The LDR sensors will send analog signals to the Arduino, indicating the light intensity in different directions. The Arduino will process this data to determine the optimal direction for the panel to face.
Servo Motor Control:
Two servo motors will control the panel's movement: one for horizontal (east-west) and the other for vertical (up-down) adjustments. The Arduino will send signals to the servos to rotate them based on the LDR readings.
Feedback and Adjustment:
The Arduino will continuously monitor the LDRs and adjust the panel's position every few seconds to keep it aligned with the sun's movement.

Conclusion:
This solar tracker ensures that the solar panel remains optimally aligned with the sun throughout the day, maximizing its energy collection. The system can be further enhanced by adding a real-time clock (RTC) module to reset the panel to its original position during night-time.
